## Description:

Greetings!

This **Checkout Page** is an HTML workshop offered by freeCodeCamp. 

The goal of this project is to design and implement an HTML-based order checkout page that is fully accessible to all users, including those relying on assistive technologies. By applying semantic HTML elements and accessibility attributes—such as aria-label, aria-required, and descriptive alt text—the page ensures compatibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation.

This includes:

- Clear and structured heading hierarchy for seamless navigation.
- Properly labeled form fields for payment information.
- Required input elements enhanced with ARIA attributes for validation cues.
- Buttons and images with accessible labels and alternative text.
- Thoughtful use of landmarks and sections to organize content meaningfully.
Ultimately, this project promotes inclusive design by aligning with modern web accessibility standards and best practices.
